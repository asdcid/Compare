## Requirments
  **Script required**
  - timeout (https://github.com/pshved/timeout, for the CPU time and memory usage limitation)
  - Snakemake v5.13.0
  - Python packages: biopython, gzip
  
  **Software to compare** (can add or remove any software)
  - Decenttree
  - RapidNJ v2.3.2
  - FastME v2.1.6.2
  - Quicktree v2.5 (single threads)
  - BioNJ (single threads)
  - Fasttree v2.1.11 (Using FasttreeMP for multiple threads) **Not use, because it does not support dist format**


  **Optional**
  - IQ-Tree (for Multiple sequence alignment format conversion, from `.fasta` to `.dist`)
  - seqtk, pigz (for subsampling the alignments)

## Usage
### 1. Download the pipeline
```
https://github.com/asdcid/Snakemake-of-neighbor-joining-software.git
```

### 2. Input format

The supported input format of each software (TODO test .gz of all)

|  Software | MSA | Distance matrix |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Decenttree  | .fasta(.gz)  | Yes |
| Fasttree  | .fasta, .phylip  | No |
| RapidNJ  | .fasta, .sth  | Yes |
| FastME  | ?  | Yes |
| BioNJ  | No  | Yes |
| Quicktree  | .sth  | Yes |

>MSA: Multiple sequence alignment; .sth: Stockholm format. 

>For FastME, altough their manual said it supports MSA input with sequence alignment, but the face seems to be not.Â 

- If you want to change the format of file MSA from .fasta to .sth, using `convert2stockholm.py`:

```
python convert2stockholm.py $inputFile $outputFile
```

- If you want to subsample the reads, using ``:
- 
```
1. subread < total reads, if subread > total reads, output all reads

```

***NOTE***
>The name of input alignment file should not contain ':'.

### 3. Modify the configure file `config.yaml`

```
# The path of directory including the input alignments.
INPUTDIR : '/path/of/input/directory'

# The format of input alignment. Only support MSA in fasta (fasta) or stockholm format (sth), or distance matrix (dist)
INPUTFORMAT : 'dist' 

# The path of output directory
OUTPUTDIR : '/path/of/output/directory'


# Memory limit, kb, 1,000,000,000 = 1 Tb
MEMLIMIT : 1000000000

# CPU limit, seconds, 43200s = 12 hours
TIMELIMIT : 43200


# How many threads you want to use to compare, can be only one value. For example, only use 5 threads: [5]
THREADS : [64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]


# The software you want to use to compare, but can only use single thread. Can be empty []
SOFTWARE_SINGLE_THREAD : ['bionj', 'quicktree']

# The software you want to use to compare, but can use multiple threads. Can be empty []
SOFTWARE_MULTIPLE_THREADS : ['decenttree', 'rapidnj', 'fastme', 'fasttree']

```

### 4. Run
```
# $NUM is the threads you want to use, should not be less than the maximum THREADS in `config.yaml`.
snakemake --cores $NUM
```

Each software in `SOFTWARE_SINGLE_THREAD` will run each alignment in the input directory with different threads in `THREADS` (`config.yaml`), and each softare in `SOFTWARE_MULTIPLE_THREADS` will run each alignment in the input directory with single thread.

### 5. Output files

This pipeline outputs three files of each {software}:{threads}:{alignment} combination

```
# The output of timeout and error message during the running. 
# Exceed the CPU time limitation : TIMEOUT 
# Exceed the memory usage        : MEM 
# Not exceeding time and memory  : FINISH
{software}:{threads}:{alignment}.errorLog

# The output of /usr/bin/time, including the CPU times, memory usage
{software}:{threads}:{alignment}.timeLog

# The output tree file
{software}:{threads}:{alignment}.newick
```

For example, if run `decenttree` with `8` threads, and the input alignments is `1000_SSU_NR99.fasta.gz`, 

the output files are:

`decenttree:8:1000_SSU_NR99.fasta.gz.errorLog`

`decenttree:8:1000_SSU_NR99.fasta.gz.timeLog`

`decenttree:8:1000_SSU_NR99.fasta.gz.newick`



### 6. Add new software or remove the default software

***Add new software***

If you want to add new software to this snakemake pipeline, you need to change `config.yaml` and `snakefile`.

**A. `config.yaml`**

- New software with *multiple* threads: add it into `SOFTWARE_MULTIPLE_THREADS` in `config.yaml`. 
 
Such as 
 ```
 SOFTWARE_MULTIPLE_THREADS : ['decenttree', 'new_multiple_software']
 ```

- New software with *single* threads  : add it into `SOFTWARE_SINGLE_THREADS` in `config.yaml`. 

If it is added into the `SOFTWARE_MULTIPLE_THREADS`, it will be repeatly run multiple times (depending on how many threads combination you set in `THREADS`).

**B. `snakefile`**

Set the new rule in the `snakefile`. You can directly copy other `rule`, and modify it as follow:
- 1. **Line 1**     : Give the new rule a name by replacinig RULENAME, such as `iqtree`
- 2. **Line 6**     : Change the in NEW_SOFTWARE to the name of new software. It is the log message.
- 3. **Line 12-14** : A. Change the `{software}` to the name you put in `SOFTWARE_MULTIPLE/SINGLE_THREADS` in `config.yaml`. B. If the software use only *single* threads, change `{threads}` to `1`. If the software can use *multiple* threads, you don't need to change `{threads}`. 
  For example:
  ```
      output:
        errorLog=os.path.join(outputDir, "{software}:1:{alignmentName}.errorLog"),
        timeLog=os.path.join(outputDir, "{software}:1:{alignmentName}.timeLog"),
        tree=os.path.join(outputDir, "{software}:1:{alignmentName}.newick")
  ```
- 4. **Line 20**    : Replace the `COMMAND` with the commonds of the new software.
<p>
  <img src="https://github.com/asdcid/figures/blob/master/Snakemake%20of%20neighbor%20joining/rule_code.png" />
 </p>


The name should be the same in rule (`snakefile`) and in SOFTWARE_SINGLE/MULTIPLE_THREAD (`config.yaml`)

***Remove existing software***

If you don't want to compare some software, just remove them from `SOFTWARE_SINGLE_THREAD` or `SOFTWARE_MULTIPLE_THREADS` in `config.yaml`. 

Don't need to change the `snakefile`.

For example, if you only want to run `decenttree`, just set the `SOFTWARE` in `config.yaml`:
```
SOFTWARE_SINGLE_THREAD : []
SOFTWARE_MULTIPLE_THREADS : ['decenttree']
```



**NOTE**
>1. All software should be in the environment variable, if not, do
```
export PATH="/place/with/the/file":$PATH
```
